#Redirecting the browser using JS

**Window.location object is a readonly object**. There are two ways to change this property so that browser is redirected to a URL.
1.	Href property : Simply assign to a URL.
This puts the redirect page in history
2.	Replace function: Pass url to the function
This doesnâ€™t put the redirect page in history (it replaces it) and is to be preferred by default.
